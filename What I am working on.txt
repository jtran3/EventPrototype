Tried looking over the code and php again for syntex errors that might make the login not work. Couldn't find any after yesterdays change for now. looked up W/OpenGLRenderer: Failed to set EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR on surface 0xaa402ac0, error=EGL_SUCCESS
to see if it was stopping the code but no luck. reviewed the example over again from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBfyQgkiAA but no luck. Going to try out create event tomorrow to keep my mind off of it until i can find 
the answer with login.

Looked over the loginRequest and got rid of an error i made in it but the login still doesn't go to the user area. Started looking over how to keep presisent data from android boot camp book and looking at sending a text message from the app with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paAjAEOsh2w
and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F73tf7ySAZU for contacts to get a understanding of how to do it.

Looked over the database to see if the values are right. Created Login2.php in case the first login doesn't work i would restart it with a different example. figured out that the Login.php had a little error where the setup
for mysqli_stmt_bind_param was wrong so i corrected it. retry the test and come up with another error which is " org.json.JSONException: Value <br><table of type java.lang.String cannot be converted to JSONObject ".

was looking over https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_PaSTBkUwk4PXlhZIe4COpwnWeCRnw2F and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4_1UOFNLEY to understand how to do contacts. Going to ask partner which one to use tomorrow.

Looking into ways of sending text to selected contacts only. Looking over http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24736994/send-sms-on-selected-contact-in-android and http://www.sachinmuralig.me/2013/11/android-simple-multi-contacts-picker.html for help.

Still looking for a good example on selecting multiple contacts to send a text message to them. found some example about sending text through https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op_7cUKceaA&t=599s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9jhgbiK2Q 
but still nothing on selecting multiple contacts from my list.
