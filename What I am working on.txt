Tried looking over the code and php again for syntex errors that might make the login not work. Couldn't find any after yesterdays change for now. looked up W/OpenGLRenderer: Failed to set EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR on surface 0xaa402ac0, error=EGL_SUCCESS
to see if it was stopping the code but no luck. reviewed the example over again from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBfyQgkiAA but no luck. Going to try out create event tomorrow to keep my mind off of it until i can find 
the answer with login.
